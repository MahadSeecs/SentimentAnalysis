PROBLEM: During these difficult times of Covid-19, governments have had to take tough decisions to curb the virus’ spread. These restrictions not only suppress the basic right to movement but also affect the economic status of the citizens especially daily wagers. Therefore, people develop a sentiment to these measures, whether negative or positive.
SOLUTION: One very common place where people openly express these sentiments is on social media, whether it’s through their own posts or by showing support to posts made by a more famous personality on that social media app. Therefore, a general sentiment can be extracted from this data.
RESOURCES: For my project, I will be using the Twitter API and the tweepy library to interact with the data available. I will then generate a sentiment analysis on the data set of tweets on a certain issue. 
IMPACT: This result will, for example, allow governments to either enforce their decision to make vaccines mandatory at that point in time or later when the people’s sentiment is more supportive towards those decisions.
